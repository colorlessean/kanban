# Service Directory

This is the home of all the microservices that will go into this application.

All are inteded to be written using Go but may adapt as the needs change over time.

Currently there is a basic testing service at the root of the directory however this will likely disappear as services beomce more filled out.

Containerizing may be preferable at a later date as well.
